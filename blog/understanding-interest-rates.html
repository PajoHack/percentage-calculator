    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Understanding Interest Rates with Percentages</h1>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. How to Calculate Interest Rates Using Percentages</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Interest rates are expressed as percentages. For example, if you invest €1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5%, you earn €50 in a year. The formula is simple: <strong>Interest = Principal × Rate × Time</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Understanding Compound Interest</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Compound interest adds interest on both the initial amount and accumulated interest. Over time, this significantly boosts savings. For instance, €1,000 at 5% compounded yearly becomes €1,276.28 in five years.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Interest Rates and Loan Costs</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Borrowing money? That 12% APR on your credit card means you pay 12% of your balance yearly in interest unless paid off. Use percentages to compare loan offers and understand true costs.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Calculating Returns on Savings</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Want to know how much your savings will grow? A percentage-based return calculation helps. For example, 3% annual return on €5,000 earns you €150 per year. Adjust for monthly compounding if applicable.</p>
