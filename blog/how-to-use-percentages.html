    <p class="mb-4">Percentages aren’t just math class material — they’re a daily part of life. Whether you’re shopping for a deal, calculating a tip, or reviewing test scores, understanding percentages can save you money and help you make smarter decisions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Shopping and Discounts</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">When a store advertises 20% off, it means you save 20 out of every 100 in currency. For example, if something costs €50 and is 20% off, you calculate 20% of €50 (€10) and subtract it. You pay €40.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Tips and Bills</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Percentages are handy when tipping at restaurants. A common tip is 10–15%. If your bill is €30 and you want to tip 15%, that’s €4.50.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. School and Exams</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you got 18 out of 20 questions right, you scored 90%. Just divide 18 by 20 and multiply by 100. Percentages make it easy to compare scores and set goals.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Budgeting and Finance</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Let’s say you want to save 25% of your monthly salary. If you earn €2,000, that’s €500 to set aside. Knowing percentages helps with savings goals, investments, and tracking expenses.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Bonus: Using Online Tools</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Sites like <a href="/index.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Percentopia</a> let you calculate percentages instantly — perfect for fast, accurate answers on the go.</p>
