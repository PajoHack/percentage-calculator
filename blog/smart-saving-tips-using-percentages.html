    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Save 10 Percent of Your Income Automatically</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">One of the simplest ways to build savings is to automatically set aside 10% of your monthly income. If you earn €2,500 a month, that's €250 straight into savings. This percentage-based strategy builds a habit and grows your funds steadily.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Use Percentages to Cut Expenses</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Cutting 15–20% from non-essential categories like dining out or entertainment can free up money for your goals. For example, if you spend €200 a month on takeout, cutting 20% saves you €40 monthly.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Plan Percentage-Based Budgets</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A common rule is the 50/30/20 plan: 50% of income for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. This gives structure to your spending and ensures you’re saving consistently.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Set Goals with Percentage Milestones</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Rather than saying "I’ll save some money," aim for a specific percentage. For instance, decide to save 25% of your holiday budget by July. Clear targets are easier to track and more motivating.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Use Online Tools to Calculate Your Goals</h2>
